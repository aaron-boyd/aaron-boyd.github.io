### Achiever

---

In Aaron's last coop is Northrop Grumman he achieved the accolade of "Top Performer". This means he performed in the top 10% of interns company-wide. Aaron believes this strength will keep him moving when work is dull and push him to succeed when work is difficult.Google


### Maximizer

---

During Aaron's time at the University of Cincinnati, he has sought out to surround himself and network with other individuals of greater talent. Surrounding himself with these individuals allowed him to polish his computer science strengths by learning from their excellence. This was also a great networking experience for Aaron and he was able to get his first coop through the connections he made. This strength of seeking out others will eliminate complacency and push Aaron to keep getting better and learn from the people he surrounds himself with.

### Futuristic

---

Through the development of [Rangemaster](/content/projects/rangemaster) Aaron has used his planning skills to foresee design decisions that would inhibit future functionality. By making long term design decisions for Rangemaster, Aaron's team has avoided correcting faulty design decisions with lengthy and time consuming refactors. These planning strengths will help Aaron succeed in future large scale projects by seeing problems before they happen, therefore, allowing better design decisions and cost savings.

### Learner

---

Aaron has exhibited the love to learn during his coops. Many times he has been asked to do something that he had no idea had to do. This required a large amount of research and learning on his part and contributed to completing his tasks on time and to satisfaction of his managers. This craving for knowledge will serve Aaron well in the future because computer science is an ever-evolving field and requires constant learning.

### Analytical

---

While working with students in [CATiSE](/content/involvement/catise), Aaron has been a voice of reason during mission design meetings. The freshman of 2019 wanted to drop a glider from high altitude and have it fly home. They also wanted to put solar cells on the wings, a can of coke in the body, and a device to collect clouds on the outer body. Aaron analyzed the mission concept and was able to inform them that their wishful thinking was unfeasible and would lead to disaster. This strength will help avoid over-promising and under-delivering in the future. Keeping ideas and missions rooted in reality.
