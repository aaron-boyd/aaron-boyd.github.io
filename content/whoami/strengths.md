During Aaron's time at the University of Cincinnati, he has sought out to surround himself and network with other individuals of greater talent. Surrounding himself with these individuals allowed him to polish his computer science strengths by learning from their excellence. This was also a great networking experience for Aaron and he was able to get his first coop through the connections he made. This strength of seeking out others will eliminate complacency and push Aaron to keep getting better and learn from the people he surrounds himself with.
